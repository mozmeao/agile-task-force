Generally how things work for the Mozilla.org Durable Team (we are, primarily, a service organization)

## Work Intake

*How work comes to the team and where does it go to get triaged*

   Work requests come in to the mozilla.org durable team from both durable and functional teams from across MoCo & MoFo.
   
      * The intake funnels are:
         * Bugs filed in bugzilla
         * Briefs submitted using the Tier 1 template to David Tenser (Team Lead) and Eric Renaud (Program Manager)
   * Triage
      * Briefs - are submitted to David Tenser for SLT level approval, when briefs are approved they then come to the team for in depth review in a kickoff meeting with the requesting team
      * Bugs - These are reviewed by one or more of the moz.org team members depend on the nature of the bug. Currently the PM (Eric Renaud) has a weekly meeting for [Bug Triage](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=dorem&remaction=run&namedcmd=mozilla.org%20needs%20triage&sharer_id=148348&list_id=14026853) with another team member that/who revolves on a monthly basis.
   * Prioritization
      * Work is prioritized according to the model [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MnxtGiPuYZ1KxFY-KM-NQh7VFlaysJp7gB4rBkJyFXo/edit)

## Approval Process

*Once work is proposed how is it evaluated, what happens if it is approved what if it is put on hold?*

## Backlog

The mozilla.org [backlog](https://tree.taiga.io/project/malexis-mozillaorg-durable-team/backlog) is populated in Taiga and identified in the Kanban board as 'Incoming'.

## Board Details

* Board columns:  Incoming | Research | Ready | In progress | Review | Done | Archived 
* How/when to cards move across the board*
Cards are moved by any member of the team when a change in status is indentified. Chiefly this falls to the Program Manager, then to the individuals owning a card at the given moment until such time the state changes.
* What does done mean*
Done means a fully approved (Accountable/Approver) work item is complete according to the established Acceptance Criteria. Most commonly, but not exclusively, this means the results of the body of work are live on mozilla.org or blog.mozilla.org.


## Daily Standups

*How / when to stand ups occur, what happens during a meeting, be brief!*
* Stand up & Status - Mondays at 9-9:30 am PT - Stand up followed by project status review 
* Stand ups - Tuesdays & Thursdays at 9-9:15 am PT
* Team time - Wednesdays at 9-10 am PT - recurring, non-required meeting where we attempt realize the benefits of colocation (as we are not colocated)


## Retrospectives

Team Retrospectives are held every three weeks. These are 'team only' meetings, defined as safe spaces in which candid commentary is allowed and expected with the intent learn from previous circumstances
We focus on:

* What can be improved/what new things can we do
